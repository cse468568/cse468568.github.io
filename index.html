                        In accordance with the departmental policy on academic integrity violations, we will enforce for the following procedure:
                        
                        1. If the violation is the student's second academic violation, then it will result in an automatic F letter grade in the course.
                        2. If the violation is the first ever academic violation, then it will result in a minimum of a letter grade reduction in the grade for course and zero in the relevant assignment/exam. 
                        If the violation is serious enough, then it can result in an F in the course. While it gives me no pleasure in failing students, I will do so since I have to be fair to (the vast majority) of students who do not cheat. Please read the homework policies to make sure you follow all the rules and do not violate academic integrity.
